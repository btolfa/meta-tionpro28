I. Building the meta-tionpro28 BSP layer
========================================

Follow https://github.com/Freescale/fsl-community-bsp-platform

Download meta-tionpro28 distribution

  cd ~/fsl-community-bsp/sources
  git clone git@github.com:btolfa/meta-tionpro28.git

You can build a tionpro28 image by adding the location of the meta-tionpro28
layer to bblayers.conf, along with any other layers needed (to access
common metadata shared between BSPs) e.g.:

  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-tionpro28 \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-xxxx \

To enable the tionpro28 layer, add the tionpro28 MACHINE to local.conf:

  MACHINE ?= "tionpro28"

You should then be able to build a tionpro28 image as such:

  $ source setup-environment build
  $ bitbake core-image-minimal

At the end of a successful build, you should have a live image that
you can boot from a SD.

II. Booting the images

This BSP contains bootable live images for sd card

Under Linux, insert a SD card.  Assuming the SD card takes device /dev/sdf,
use dd to copy the live image to it.  For example:


$ sudo dd if=core-image-minimal-tionpro28.sdcard of=/dev/sdf bs=1M
# sync
# eject /dev/sdf

This should give you a bootable SD card.  Insert the device
